## DSA210 2025-Spring // Term Project Proposal - League of Legends Professional Player's Performance Analysis

### Motivation
Professional e-sports players in League Of Legends (LOL) often have varying performances from one tournament season to the next. This project aims to understand how their performance and playstyle in their practice/casual matches during the offseason correlates to their ability to perform in the major tournaments and leagues.

### Data / Data Collection Methods
- The main source of data will be acquired through official Riot Games APIs, as well as their enumeration of professional tournament matches on [League of Legends Esports Wiki](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Esports_Wiki).
- To supplement this data, third-party sites like OP.GG and U.GG will be used to track pro players' off-season games and provide pre-built performance indicators, that will provide support to our method of performance analysis.
- These datasets will be merged to establish a comprehensive comparison of tournament vs. off-season performance. The data will then be cleaned and pre-processed to allow for smoother analysis.
- To allow for the analysis of external factors on the performance of these players, we'll utilise the meta changes, patch notes, and balance changes recorded by riot games with each patch.
