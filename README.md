## DSA210 Spring25 Term Project Proposal - League of Legends Professional Player's Performance Analysis

### Motivation
Professional e-sports players in League Of Legends (LOL) often have varying performances from one tournament season to the next. This project aims to understand how their performance and playstyle in their practice/casual matches during the offseason correlates to their ability to perform in the major tournaments and leagues.

### Data / Data Collection Methods
The main source of data will be acquired through official Riot Games API's, as well as their enumeration of professional tournament matches on https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Esports_Wiki. For a supporting data provision, third-party sites like op.gg and u.gg will be used, to keep track of the pro-players off-season games as well as to provide a supporting pre-built method of performance indicator, that these sites usually have. The datasets will be merged to establish a comprehensive comparison of tournament vs off-season performance. The data will then be cleaned and pre-processed to allow for smoother analysis.
